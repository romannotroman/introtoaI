    "**Backpropagation (\"backward propagation of errors\")** is an algorithm for **supervised learning of artificial neural networks using gradient descent.** Given an artificial neural network and an error function, the method calculates the gradient of the error function with respect to the neural network's weights.\n",

    "### Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning** is the machine learning technique of inferring a function from labeled training data.\n",
    "In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an **input object** (typically a vector) and a **desired output value.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical steps:\n",
    "1. Gather a data. \n",
    "2. Determine the input feature representation of the learned function.\n",
    "3. Design a model which will be trained.\n",
    "4. Evaluate the accuracy of the learned model.\n",

    "Here are the steps to k-means clustering:\n",
    "1. Define the k centroids (central point of the cluster).\n",
    "2. Find the closest centroid & update cluster assignments.\n",
    "3. Move the centroids to the center of their clusters.\n",

    "One network generates candidates and the other evaluates them.\n",
    "The **generative network's** training objective ****is to increase the error** rate of the discriminative network** (i.e., \"fool\" the discriminator network by producing novel synthesized instances that appear to have come from the true data distribution).\n",
